# ⚖️ Fulcrum

Fulcrum is a reverse proxy and load balancer capable of distributing HTTP traffic across a cluster of backend servers. Built with a focus on concurrency control, retries (fault tolerance), and observability, it features active health checks, automatic failover retries, and a real-time analytics dashboard.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Intelligent Routing**: Implements the **Least Connections** strategy to optimize load distribution (with Round Robin fallback).
- **Active Health Checks**: Periodically pings backends via TCP; automatically removes dead nodes from rotation and reintegrates them upon recovery.
- **Fault Tolerance & Retries**: Automatically retries failed requests on healthy backends using context-aware error handling.
- **Live Dashboard**: A visualization of connection pools, error rates, and server status in real-time.
- **Observability**: Custom middleware for detailed request logging (latency, status codes, method).
- **Concurrency Safe**: Uses `sync/atomic` for lock-free counter increments and `sync.RWMutex` for safe state management.

## 🛠️ Architecture

Fulcrum acts as a Layer 7 Proxy. It accepts incoming traffic on a defined port, modifies the headers (X-Forwarded-For), and streams the request to a healthy backend.

```
User Request  --->  [ FULCRUM LB (:8000) ]  --->  [ Backend A (:5001) ]
                           |                    |
                           |                    --->  [ Backend B (:5002) ]
                    [ Health Checker ]          |
                           |                    --->  [ Backend C (:5003) ]
                    [ Dashboard (:8081) ]
```

## 📦 Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

- Go 1.21+

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manpreet-Bhatti/Fulcrum.git
cd Fulcrum
```

2. **Configure Backends**

```json
{
  "lb_port": 8000,
  "backends": [
    {
      "name": "backend-1",
      "url": "http://localhost:5001"
    },
    {
      "name": "backend-2",
      "url": "http://localhost:5002"
    },
    {
      "name": "backend-3",
      "url": "http://localhost:5003"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Start the Dummy Backend Cluster**

This repo includes a helper tool to spin up test servers. Open 3 terminal tabs:

```bash
# Terminal 1
go run backend/main.go -port 5001 -name "backend-1"

# Terminal 2
go run backend/main.go -port 5002 -name "backend-2"

# Terminal 3
go run backend/main.go -port 5003 -name "backend-3"
```

4. **Run Fulcrum**

```bash
go run main.go
```

## 🎮 Usage & Demo

**Send Traffic**

Send requests to the load balancer:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000
```

*Observe the backend logs to see the traffic rotating*

**View Dashboard**

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081`

- Watch **Active Requests** spike during load.
- Kill a backend server and watch the status turn **OFFLINE**.
- Restart the backend server and watch it self-heal to **ONLINE**.

**Simulate Failure (Retries)**

1. Kill `backend-1`.
2. Run `curl -v http://localhost:8000`.
3. Fulcrum will detect the failure, log a retry, and serve the response from `backend-2` without the client noticing.
